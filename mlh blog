    <h1>MLH: Major League Hacking </h1>

    <p>Its my first time participating in a hackathon and its been pretty awesome. The workshop timings makes schedule a bit uncomfortable but its fun to attend them and worth the time invested. I for real am learning alot and got an exposure to the vast types of things I can do other than taking lectures from university all day. </p>
      <p1>If you want a change of pace and some free tutorials with lots of valuable information this is the best place.</p1>
      <p2>
      The community is pretty welcoming and easy to talk with so its pretty easy for anyone to blend in with.  </p2>
